## üìã Quick Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Domain name pointing to your server
- Ports 80 and 443 accessible

### Configuration Steps

**1. Clone and Configure**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehtishammubarik/nextcloud-ssl.git
cd nextcloud-ssl
```

**2. Database Configuration**
Edit `docker-compose.yaml` and configure your database credentials:
```yaml
environment:
  - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
  - MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_secure_password  
  - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
  - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
```

**3. Launch Infrastructure**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**4. Configure SSL/TLS**
```bash
cd data/nginx
# Edit app.conf - replace example.org with your domain
vim app.conf

cd ../../test  
# Edit init-letsencrypt.sh - add your domain and email
vim init-letsencrypt.sh

# Execute SSL certificate provisioning
sudo bash init-letsencrypt.sh
```

**5. Verify Deployment**
```bash
docker ps  # Confirm all containers are running
```

Access your secure Nextcloud instance at `https://YOUR_DOMAIN.COM`
